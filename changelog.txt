  setLayer(int)
	Will set this element to the specified draw index.
	Elements within groups are limited to the group’s inner layer.
	Moving higher will shift affected elements lower.
	Moving lower will shift affected elements higher.
  placeBelow(EZElement)
	Will set this elements draw layer below the specified element.
	Done by extracting this element and placing below the specified element.

V1.10
1/8/15
Fixes made to EZImage.
  If a focus area is set getWidth and getHeight methods now return the width and height of the focus area
	rather than the image original width and height.
  If a focus area is set isPointInElement() will return true if the point is within the new adjusted area
	based upon the width and height of the focus area around the center instead of using the entire image
	boundaries.
	
Changes made to EZInteraction.
  Added getXMouse and getYMouse method which will return the corresponding coordinate of the mouse if it is
    on the window. If not, then the methods will return -1. This was made to remove the following methods.
    
  Depreciated getXMouseMove, getYMouseMove, getXMouseClick, getYMouseClick.
    The get move methods just returned the location of the mouse if it was over the window.
    The click checks should be used to determine which button was clicked. Otherwise the location of the
      cursor at time of click is its position on the window at that time. The only difference is that the
      get click methods returned -1 if the click methods returned false, but the cursor is still on window.

V1.09
11/10/14

Major updates to EZImage, EZInteraction, and EZSound.

EZImage now allows for subsection focusing. Significance is ability to use sprite sheets.
  public void setFocus(int xTopLeftCorner, int yTopLeftCorner, int xBottomRightCorner, int yBottomRightCorner)
	The four int parameters represent two points. Upper left and lower right to form a rectangle.
	The area marked by the rectangle within the image will be displayed rather than the whole image.
	In this manner it is also possible to flip the image based upon the position of the two points.
  public void releaseFocus()
    Will release the focus and revert to displaying the entire image.
  public boolean hasFocus()
    Will return true if a focus area has been set, otherwise false.

EZInteraction now allows for better mouse button checks with respect to left and right mouse buttons.
Much like keys, it is possible to check if the left/right mouse button was pressed, is down, or was released.
	public static boolean wasMouseLeftButtonPressed()
	public static boolean wasMouseRightButtonPressed() 
	public static boolean isMouseLeftButtonDown()
	public static boolean isMouseRightButtonDown()
	public static boolean wasMouseLeftButtonReleased()
	public static boolean wasMouseRightButtonReleased()
The getXMouseMove() and getYMouseMove() have also been changed to detect mouse movement even if the button is down.

EZSound has bug fixes and a number of support methods added.
	public void play()
	  Will now play based upon position on the file.
	public void stop()
	  Will now stop the sound file and reset the position to the start.
	public void pause()
	  Has been added, this will halt the sound at its current position. Using play() will resume from that position.
	public int getFrameLength()
	  Will return the number of frames in the sound file.
	public int getFramePosistion()
	  Will return the current position with respect to frame number.
	public long getMicroSecondLength()
	  Will return the length of the sound file in microseconds.
	public long getMicroSecondPosition()
	  Will return the current position with respect to microseconds.
	public void setFramePosition(int pos) 
	  Will set the current position to the specified frame number.
	public void setMicrosecondPosition(int pos)
	  Will set the current position to the specified microsecond position, but limited by frame association.
	public double getLevel()
	  Might return the amplitude of the current position. Doesn't work on all systems due to sound driver support.
